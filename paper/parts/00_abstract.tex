\abstract{
    We have been tasked with creating a program which will compare two given code snippets - one of which will be used as a specification whereas the other one will semantically differ from the specification - and synthesize a new code snippet which will use the ``invalid'' snippet as the base, but edited to fit the specification. Since it has already been proven that the semantical code comparison problem is indecisive (Halting problem), there is no way to successfully give an answer for the entire code snippet space. However, some subsets of aforementioned space can be tested and even though in some cases we cannot say for certain if what we have found is a bug or not we can provide a false-positive warning. The algorithm we use to compare the two requires matching and traversing the abstract syntax trees of both code snippets. For the task of matching code elements we are using GumTree API and as for the traversal we decided to use the JDT Core DOM API which unfortunately limits us to only Java code snippets.
