\section{Assumptions and limitations}
\label{sec:AssumptionsAndLimitations}

In the previous chapter we have shown how certain code structures (loops for example) can be hard to analyze. Therefore we have set a certain number of assumptions on the input code snippets:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All variables have to be initialized before their use
    \item All functions are assumed not to have side effects
    \item Branching condition value needs to be known at compile-time
\end{itemize}

Apart from these assumptions, we have ignored the following in order to make the problem easier:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All data types except int
    \item All code constructs except declarations, assignments, branching statements and arithmetic operators
\end{itemize}
